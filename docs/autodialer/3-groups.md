# Groups

Add a list of numbers in this section by clicking the âž• button. After adding, you can include your group for bulk contacts when creating a campaign.

Ensure Excel files are uploaded in formats (csv, vcf), with all numbers arranged in a single column. The Excel file should contain only one column where the numbers are placed.

## Groups Parameters

- **Name**: The name of the group.

- **Contacts**: If you have added numbers in the contacts section, you can select them here. This is done to consolidate information into one group.

- **Import**: Select your Excel file in this section.

- **Description**: Add a description for the group.
