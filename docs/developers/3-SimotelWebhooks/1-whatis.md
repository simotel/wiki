# What is

**Simotel Webhooks** handles the task of sending requests from Simotel to your server. For example, if you want to send CDR (Call Detail Records) data to your server's address after every call ends, you can easily do this using Simotel Webhooks.

Simotel Webhooks are divided into two different types:

- **Event Webhooks**
- **ComponentApi Webhooks**
