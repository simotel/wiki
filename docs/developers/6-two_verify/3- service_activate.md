# Service Activation
After preparing the service file, log in to your Simult panel. In the "Maintenance >> Settings" section, under "SMS Services," upload the prepared service file by clicking the "Add Service" button. Then, select the uploaded service in the "SMS Service" section. Use "Edit" to set the module_params variables (note that this variable is key and will be read and set by Simult). After uploading, you can test with "Send SMS" if needed. 

Next, in the "General Settings" page, change the login type from single-step to two-step (ensure the user has entered a valid and active mobile number).
