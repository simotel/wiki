### Tabs in the Operators Section

- **Column View**: Operators are displayed in columns based on their current status, such as "Ringing", "On Call", and so on. When their status changes, the operator is moved to a new column.
  
- **List View**: Operators are displayed in rows (sorted) regardless of their status. This view provides more detailed information compared to the column view.

- **Grid View**: Operators are displayed side-by-side in a tiled (and organized) layout.

- **Charts**: Statistical information about the queues is displayed in several chart formats.

- **Filters**: The **Filters** tab allows customization of the previous views. You can filter the display to show operators with specific statuses.
