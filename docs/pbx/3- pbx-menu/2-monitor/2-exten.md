The **Extensions** menu displays the real-time status of all extensions.

### Tabs in the Extensions Section

- **Column View**: Extensions are displayed in predefined columns based on their status, such as "Ringing", "On Call", etc. When their status changes, the extension is moved to a new column.

- **List View**: Extensions are displayed in rows (sorted) regardless of their status. This view provides more detailed information compared to the column view.

- **Grid View**: Extensions are displayed side-by-side in a tiled (and organized) layout.

- **Charts**: Statistical information about the queues is displayed in several chart formats.

- **Filters**: The **Filters** tab allows customization of the previous views. You can filter the display to show extensions with specific statuses.
