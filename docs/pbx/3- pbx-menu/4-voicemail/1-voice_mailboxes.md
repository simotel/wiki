# Voicemail Boxes

In Simotel, each user can have their own dedicated voicemail box. After defining the user, a voicemail box must be created for them in the Voicemail menu. It is not necessary for the voicemail box number to match the userâ€™s number in the system, but for better management of the voicemail boxes in the editor, it is recommended to name them identically.

## Voicemail Box Parameters

- **Number**: The voicemail box number (used in internal communication and the editor, similar to an extension).
