# Introduction

A "storm call" refers to a set of similar calls that typically occur in a specific period of time and usually share a common purpose. For example, imagine a power outage in a particular area of a city due to a malfunction, which lasts for half an hour. Residents of that area will call the utility company's hotline to report the issue. This surge of calls from a specific area is called a "storm call." By recognizing the area code, pre-configured response behaviors can be implemented to handle calls from that region.
