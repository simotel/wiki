# Trunk API

## **Purpose**

The **Trunk API** is used to initiate calls over a trunk, similar to the standard **Trunk** component. The key difference is that with the **Trunk API**, the trunk name and the destination extension number are provided through a web service, and the call is routed directly to the specified extension using the trunk.

## **Usage**

- The **Trunk API** allows developers to programmatically initiate a call by specifying the trunk and the destination number (extension) through an API request.
- It simplifies the process of routing calls via external trunks using automation, making it ideal for integrating with other systems or services.

For further details on how to use the **Trunk API**, please refer to the official documentation: **[here](/developers/SimotelWebhooks/DialplanApiComponents/trunk_api)**. 

This functionality is essential for scenarios where calls need to be dynamically routed based on external inputs or automated systems, such as Call Centers, integration with CRM systems, or custom dialing applications.
