# Mix Monitor

## Usage

In addition to the call recording parameter in the queue or internal, this component can also perform call recording. For example, for an organization where internal call recording is disabled, if you want to record calls in a specific path, you can use this component.

## Component Parameters

- **Type**: The type of recording operation
  - **Start Recording**: To start recording a call in the call path.
  - **Stop Recording**: To stop recording a call in the call path (recording stops automatically at the end of the call, so there is no need to stop it manually).

- **Option**: Call settings.
