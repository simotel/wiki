# Smart API

This is a semi-interactive component for executing a combination of different commands on the server. The SmartApi receives commands via a web service and applies them sequentially to the call (for more details, please refer to **[here](/developers/SimotelWebhooks/DialplanApiComponents/smart_api)**).
