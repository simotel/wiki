# Extension API

The **Extension API** is used to route calls to a specific extension, similar to the **Extension** component. The key difference is that the destination extension number is received through a web service. The call is then routed to that extension without the need for predefined configuration in the system.

For more details and implementation, please refer to the [Extension API documentation](/developers/SimotelWebhooks/DialplanApiComponents/exten_api).
