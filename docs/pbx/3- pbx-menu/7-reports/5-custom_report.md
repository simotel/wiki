# User Reports

Although advanced reporting allows for the generation of any type of report, some reports may require various filter settings or may be derived from a combination of several reports. Therefore, user reporting aims to create simpler, practical reports through various applications. Below are the types of these reports.

## Types of Reports

1. **Agents**: Report on the performance and activity of operators in the queue.

2. **Outgoing Calls**: Statistical report of outgoing internal calls.

3. **Incoming Calls**: Statistical report of incoming internal calls.

4. **Total Calls**: Statistical report of all incoming, outgoing, and internal calls.

5. **Daily Poll**: Statistical report of survey scores segmented by days of the week.

6. **Queue Effective Calls**: This report assesses the impact of calls entering the queue by categorizing them into three call durations: short, normal, and long. Calls are divided based on two times, MinTalk and MaxTalk, and the numbers falling within these ranges are displayed statistically and graphically.

7. **Direct Effective Calls**: Similar to the "Queue Effective Calls" report, but it applies to system calls.

8. **Queue Daily Metrics**: This report provides a set of metrics related to queue measurement, allowing users to monitor these metrics live through the dashboard.

9. **Area Code Calls**: A statistical report segmented by area codes and incoming system calls.

10. **Joint Calls in Two Periods**: This report shows common calls between two periods, allowing for a comparison between new and repeated calls. A new call occurs only in the second period, while a repeated call occurs in both periods. This report helps to extract numbers that have previously contacted your system and are now reaching out again for any reason (e.g., unmet needs).

11. **Repetitive Calls (Who)**: Statistical report based on the frequency of incoming calls. This report displays a maximum of 100 numbers.

12. **Repetitive Calls (Counts)**: Statistical report of call repetitions. The goal is to obtain a continuous distribution of call repetitions, such as how many calls occurred once, twice, three times, etc.

13. **Blacklist Calls**: Report of calls that have been placed on the blacklist.

14. **SPIT Calls**: Report of calls that have been subjected to spam conditions.

15. **Entry Point Calls**: Statistical report of incoming calls segmented by entry points (trunks). This report allows for comparison of call volumes based on trunks.

16. **Outgoing Point Calls**: Statistical report of outgoing calls segmented by exit points (trunks). This report allows for comparison of call volumes based on trunks.

17. **Incoming Calls by DID**: Statistical report of incoming calls segmented by destination number.

## Report Filters

This section provides general filters (from date, to date, and report type). A set of specific filters for reports is also available. To view, click on **More Options**. These filters include:

1. **Min Talk (sec)**: Minimum conversation duration.
2. **Max Talk (sec)**: Maximum conversation duration.
3. **Min Wait (sec)**: Minimum wait duration.
4. **Max Wait (sec)**: Maximum wait duration.
5. **Exten**: Restrict report to specific extensions.
6. **Group**: Restrict report to a group.
7. **Queue**: Restrict report to a queue.
8. **Label**: Tag for survey components.
9. **Abandoned Threshold**: Time threshold at which a call is considered abandoned (queue metrics reports).
10. **Answered within**: Maximum acceptable response time (queue metrics reports).
11. **Pre-Number**: Restrict report to area codes (area code calls reports).
12. **Far From (Date)**: Select the second range (Far From) for searching similar items in the initial range (From, To) (joint calls report).
