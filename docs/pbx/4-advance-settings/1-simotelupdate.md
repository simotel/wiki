# Simotel Update

To update, you can navigate to `Settings > Maintenance > update`. In the update tab, there are various sections explained in **[this section](/pbx/pbx-menu/maintenance/settings/update)**.

## Important Considerations Before Updating

Before updating, please keep in mind the following:

- **Backup File**: Make sure to create a PBX backup file from the Call Center and store it in a safe place. For more information, refer to **[this section](/pbx/pbx-menu/control-panel/backup)**.

- **Internet Access**: The server must have internet access.

:::danger Important Note
Considering that significant changes have been made to the dial plan in version 6.2, after the update, it will not be possible to revert to the previous version using Rollback, and changes to the database structure will be required. Before updating to version 6.2, ensure you have created a PBX backup from the Call Center so that you can revert to the previous version if necessary.
