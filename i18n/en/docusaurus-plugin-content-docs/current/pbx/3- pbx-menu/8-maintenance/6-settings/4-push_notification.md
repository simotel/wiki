# Push Notification

One of the features of this softphone is its ability to synchronize with the server. This means that when a call comes into the Call Center, even if the softphone is closed on your mobile device, the Simotel Call Center can activate it with a signal sent to the softphone, allowing you to answer the call. This feature is known as **Push Notification**.
